# bokbot-frontend
Front-end developed in React during the 2017 ATX Hack for Change hackathon for Bokbot, a smart chicken coop. Check out the open-source project at http://bokbot.org/.

## Installation
Run 'npm install' before you try out the interface.

## Disclaimer
The interface is operational but does not have any effects as the sensors and controllers for the chicken coop are currently disconnected. Come back for more progress as I will continue collaborating with the Bokbot team.
